# ovSAGE/LOPSA-Ottawa Meeting

### 2019-10-17 - Docker for running in a known environment

The instructions for tonight are fairly easy to manage, as we are going to take
a break from messing with docker as a thing to study, and use it as a way to
provide a consistent environment for our meeting.

## What are we doing?

We are going to do a couple of exercises as refreshers on command line
operations. I know at least a couple of people could use the refresher.

Specifically, there are two murder mysteries to solve, one using normal command
line tools and the other using SQL.

I'm going to remain vague on this, as the whole point is to have some basic
information and work from there. Think of it as like a command line version of
Myst or Riven.  

## Getting started

Open up a terminal running bash and clone the meeting repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/ottawavalleysage/ovsage-20191017.git
cd ovsage-20191017
cat instructions.md
```

At this point, you are ready to roll.

## Objectives:

1. Create a Docker base image to use as a platform for further builds
2. Create a customized container to run a known environment
3. Have a little fun with standard GNU tools and SQL statements

## References

I'll have to add those during the meeting.
