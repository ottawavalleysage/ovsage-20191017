# Instructions

Build your containers. I have provided a shell script to make it easy.

`bash ovsage-20191017.sh`

Once that has completed, launch your container:

`docker run -it <your_userid>/alpine-cli /bin/bash`

When you get the prompt, su to your userid:

`su - <your_userid>`

You should have two directories:

1. clmystery
1. sql-mysteries

Start with clmystery and cd to that. There are instructions there.

Repeat for sql-mysteries.
